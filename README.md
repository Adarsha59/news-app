# React News App with API Fetch

## Overview

This is a practice news application built with React that utilizes API calls to fetch and display news articles. The app is designed to showcase the integration of React components, state management, and asynchronous data fetching.

## Features

- Fetches news articles from a third-party API.
- Displays a list of news articles with titles, descriptions, and images.
- Implements pagination to navigate through multiple pages of news.

## Technologies Used

- React: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- [NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org/): Provides a simple API to access a wealth of news articles from various sources.

## Project Structure

The project follows a standard React application structure:


- `News.js`: The main component that manages the state, fetches data from the API, and renders the news articles.
- `NewsItems.js`: Sub-component responsible for rendering individual news items.
- `Loading.js`: Sub-component to display a loading indicator.
